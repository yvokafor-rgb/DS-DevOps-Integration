# Project Plan: Fraud Detection Hybrid Model

## Overview
This project implements a hybrid ensemble model for fraud detection, combining Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.

## Objectives
- Build and train individual models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Create a hybrid ensemble model
- Deploy the model via API
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
- Document the project for handoff

## Phases

### Phase 1: Data Preparation
- Data exploration and analysis
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Outlier removal using z-score
- SMOTE for class balancing

### Phase 2: Model Development
- Train Logistic Regression model
- Train Random Forest model
- Train Hybrid Ensemble model
- Model evaluation and comparison

### Phase 3: Deployment
- API development (FastAPI)
- Docker containerization
- Model versioning and registry

### Phase 4: CI/CD
- Automated testing
- Model validation
- Deployment automation

## Timeline
- Week 1-2: Data preparation and exploration
- Week 3-4: Model development
- Week 5: Deployment setup
- Week 6: CI/CD and documentation

## Success Criteria
- Models achieve acceptable performance metrics
- API is functional and tested
- CI/CD pipeline is operational
- Documentation is complete
